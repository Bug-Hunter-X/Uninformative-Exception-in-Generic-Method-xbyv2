# Uninformative Exception in Generic Method

This repository demonstrates a common Scala coding error involving exceptions within generic methods. The original code throws a generic `Exception` when a condition fails, making debugging difficult.

The solution shows how to use a more informative, custom exception to enhance error handling and readability. This is crucial for maintainability and effective debugging.

## How to run

The code can be compiled and executed using a Scala compiler. The `bug.scala` file shows the buggy code, while `bugSolution.scala` contains the improved version.
